# Movie Ticket Price Calculator

## Program Description:  
Write a program that calculates the price of a movie ticket based on the age of the customer and the time of day they are attending the movie.

## Program Requirements:
- Ask for the customerâ€™s age.
  - If the customer is 12 years old or younger, the ticket costs $7.
  - If the customer is between 13 and 64 years old, the ticket costs $12.
  - If the customer is 65 or older, the ticket costs $8.
- Ask for the time of the movie (in 24-hour format).
  - If the time is before 5 p.m., there is a $2 discount on the ticket.
- Output the final ticket price.
- Ensure that the program properly handles invalid inputs (e.g., negative ages, times that aren't in the 24-hour format).
 
## Example Output:
>Enter your age: 15
>
>Enter the time of the movie (24-hour format): 14
